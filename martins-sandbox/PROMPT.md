## Gaussian Process
### 1
write gaussian process implementation that would, given two dimensions (floats from -100 to 100) as input and z as output in 200 exploratory steps research the field and return 10 steps in the field that yield the highest z sum. Use test_interface to query the field. Those ten steps should be integers

### 2
now I elaborate that these ten final stops should be adjacent. Choose an appropriate starting point and make moves up, right, left, down so that the z value would be maximal. Stepping on the same position twice does not yield any additional value. Use graphs if appropriate or any other efficient representation.
